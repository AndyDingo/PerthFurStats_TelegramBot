# PerthFurStats_TelegramBot
A bot for Safe for work Telegram group chats. Could in theory be used for other groups, if the dataset is changed.

# Projects
- pfsTelegramBot is the main windows UI version of the bot, which has commands enabled.
- pfsChatLog is the Windows 10 IoT version, for Raspberry Pi, which does not have commands enabled.

# TODO (Copied from TODO.txt)
- Implement Inline commands added since Api v4.0
- Implement permissions system.
- Better implement photos.
- Better implement join/leave code.
